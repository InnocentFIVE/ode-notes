# ode-notes

this.source.tex is the little notes from *Ordinary differential Equation E4* by Gaoxiong Wang.
Actually, it is the copy of book and I just translate the content into hte Touhou shape.

~~Cirno is so cute, right?~~

Now Ill *TRANSLATE* the *Linear ODEs*.

Dont build the ".tex" arbitrarily, it **must be** contribute to the "none .errors and none PDF". Just read the PDF instead.

~~Tokiko is so cute, right?~~

## !important

I divided the note into two parts, the first is the strange conversation between Cirno et Tokiko. I dont want Tokiko to say too much and tired so, I put some **IMPORTANT** content into the part 2 "Ran et Chen".

Yep, thats it.

~~Luna is so cute, right?~~
